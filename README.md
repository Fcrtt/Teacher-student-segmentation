# Teacher-student-segmentation

This repository demonstrates the implementation of a teacher-student learning framework for semantic segmentation using knowledge distillation. The objective is to transfer the knowledge of a large DeepLabV3 model with a ResNet-101 backbone (teacher) to a smaller and more efficient ESPNet model (student), achieving comparable performance while significantly reducing computational complexity and resource requirements.

Note: This is an ongoing project, and further improvements and features are under active development. 

## Overview

Knowledge distillation is a technique to train a smaller model (student) by leveraging the outputs and intermediate representations of a larger, pretrained model (teacher). In this project, the teacher model provides soft labels and additional guidance to the student model to improve its segmentation performance.

## Key Features

- Teacher Model: DeepLabV3 with ResNet-101 backbone, pretrained on a semantic segmentation dataset
- Student Model: ESPNet, a lightweight architecture designed for real-time segmentation tasks
- Distillation Objective: Optimize the student model using a combination of:
    - Cross-entropy loss (ground truth labels)
    - Distillation loss (soft predictions from the teacher)
- Applications: Semantic segmentation tasks in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices or real-time applications.
